# SoftHeatControl

## Description

During the renovation of the last room in our house, I unfortunately forgot to lay a cable for the control of the floor heating.

The obvious solution is of course to switch the thermostats with [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) relays and connect them via a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) using MQTT. 

This ist the actual control software, which runs on a [NodeMCU ESP8266](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU). Communication also runs via MQTT.

## Technical

Close your eyes and think of England.

Just a little bit of quickly hacked C source code.
